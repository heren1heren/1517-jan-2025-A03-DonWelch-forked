        <p>Welcome to your new app.</p>
        <p>
            Within this app, you will learn about the basics of Client Server. You will
            use an solution containing a class library (application server) and a Blazor web
            application (Client manager). You will learn to use reverse engineering to
            create entity models that map your sql database. You will create services
            within your app library for use by an outside user. You will use EntityFrameworkCore
            to manage communication between your app library and database. You will
            preform various queries against the database. You will learn how to maintain
            a database record using CRUD.
